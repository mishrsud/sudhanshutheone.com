### What is this
A centralized place for the options available to generate a client that can be used to communicate with an HTTP /  REST style API.

### Problem definition
- You need to call an HTTP/REST API from C#, TypeScript or some other programming platform
- This boils down to serializing Request and Response to and from JSON, invoking the API using some sort of HTTP Client
- Hand-crafting the code to invoke the API is tedious and a good fit for code generation

### The Tools

#### When the API to call exposes an OpenAPI Spec (Swagger Doc is now OpenAPI) URL or YAML/JSON File

**Option 1: Use SwaggerHub**

1. Browse to https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/
2. Sign up (using a provider such as Github or create an account using email)
3. Go to SwaggerHUB
4. Paste the Spec in the text box ![SwaggerHub](images/swagger-hub.png)
5. Click on the Export button (top right corner) and select the platform for which client/mock needs to be generated ![Export](images/export-client.png)

**Option 2: Use NSwag Studio**
1. Get NSwag Studio from [Github](https://github.com/RSuter/NSwag)
2. In the input tab, paste the OpenAPI Spec URL or paste the spec in the text box
3. Configure parameters for generation - e.g. Scope and lifetime of HttpClient, Collection types to use etc.
4. To generate code into a file, configure a file path
5. Click generate!
