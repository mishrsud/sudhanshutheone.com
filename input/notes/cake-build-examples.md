### Gotchas

- When provisioning Nuget key, use glob pattern \*
- Other techniques to version nuget: [NerdBank GitVersion](https://github.com/AArnott/Nerdbank.GitVersioning/blob/master/doc/nbgv-cli.md) - was hard to get working on CI
- As mentioned in this [Github Thread](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/2170) the way to provide package information is to use the csproj file, don't bother creating a nuspec.
