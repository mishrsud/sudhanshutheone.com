## What is QUIC
QUIC is the name for a new experimental protocol, and it stands for Quick UDP Internet Connection.  The protocol supports a set multiplexed connections over UDP, and was designed to provide security protection equivalent to TLS/SSL, along with reduced connection and transport latency. An experimental implementation is being put in place in Chrome by a team of engineers at Google.
