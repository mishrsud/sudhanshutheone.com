## Setting up Azure CLI on Mac
Azure CLI is a cross platform CLI that can be used to automate all things Azure as well as one-off interactions with Azure. The best way to install is using Homebrew. Azure CLI is built with python3 and has a few dependencies which are taken care of when you install using homebrew.

## Step-by-step
1. Install homebrew (if you don't already have it)
2. Install Azure CLI
```bash
brew update && brew install azure-cli
```

## Troublehsooting
If you receive errors during brew install that complaint about permissions, read carefully the path to which permission is denied. The usual brew way is to download a formulae, build a keg and then create a symbolic link. A keg is placed at ```/usr/local/Cellar```

Permission issues usually occur if your current user does not have write access to:
- /usr/local/Cellar
- /usr/local/Frameworks
etc...

These messages are usually of the form
```
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.0... Error: Permission denied @ dir_s_mkdir - /usr/local/Frameworks
```
To fix this, follow the steps below:
1. Create the directory manually and change ownership to the user in question.
E.g.
```bash
sudo mkdir /usr/local/Frameworks
sudo chown user:group /usr/local/Frameworks
```
2. Then, run brew link to link the keg
```bash
brew link python
```

## Configure az cli
To configure the cli:
```bash
az configure
```
This will store settings at **/Users/username/.azure/config**
